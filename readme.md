# dirty little helpers

> A collection of helper scripts for my FreeBSD machines

Please see the `readme.md` files in the subfolders.

## Remarks

- `.sh` scripts
  - Are written to be portable
    - Do not rely on `bash`
  - Use full paths for commands so they can run in crontab
- `.py` scripts
  - scripts should work on the latest stable `python3` version on FreeBSD
