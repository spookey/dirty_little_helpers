# dirty little helpers

> A collection of helper scripts for my FreeBSD machines

Please see the ``readme`` files in the subfolders.


## Remarks

* ``.sh`` scripts
  * Are written to be portable
    * Do not rely on ``bash``
  * Use full paths for commands so they can run in crontab
* ``.py`` scripts
  * scripts should work both in ``python2`` and ``python3``
    (``python2`` will be untested, as it is end of life)
